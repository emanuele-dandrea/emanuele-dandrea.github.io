I will also try to explain to you what the goals of this little personal project are and how it was born.</p>"},{"location":"2025/04/07/is-this-the-beginning/#things-to-know-about-this-project","title":"Things to know about this project","text":"<p>This project was supposed to be a school assignment, but I decided to make it something more. At the beginning it was supposed to be a simple personal website made in <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code>, but I was intrugued by the idea of creating a blog, and after being inspired by several personal sites of amazing people, I decided I wanted to write it simply using markdown. You may wonder why you should do this? And I answer you by telling you that it is a more pragmatic and comfortable way to interface with this world, given that the functions that markdwon offers are multiple and truly useful. </p>"},{"location":"2025/04/07/is-this-the-beginning/#how-i-did-it","title":"How I did it","text":"<p>I won't go into too much detail, but first of all I'll link you to the framework I used and which was very useful for me in creating this blog. To do this I used Material for MkDocs, which allows you to create a static site that apparently has the properties of a dynamic one, but obviously it's not exactly the same thing. If you are interested in this world, you are free, in fact I urge you to go to their site where there is a step by step guide on how to create your documentation or your blog and you will find all the information you need. I also want to point out that this is just one of the many solutions that can be found on the web. Another one I know of is Jekyll, which also allows the creation of static sites and the use of markdown.</p>"},{"location":"2025/04/07/is-this-the-beginning/#hosted-with-github-pages","title":"Hosted with GitHub Pages","text":"<p>I don't currently have a server or a VPS to host the site on, so I've been making do with GitHub Pages, which isn't bad at all for hosting static sites. Again, I encourage you to check out GitHub Pages if you want to host your own small project or anything else on it.</p> <p></p> <p>About GitHub Pages</p> <p>For greater transparency, I also recommend you go to the about section related to github pages, which I will also link to for you. I hope your doubts will be further clarified.</p>"},{"location":"2025/04/07/is-this-the-beginning/#things-you-need","title":"Things you need","text":"<p>Below I list the things you should know to get started:</p> <ul> <li>know how to use git;</li> <li>you should have <code>python</code> installed on your computer;</li> <li>know something about <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code> if you want more personalization;</li> <li>know how to use properly markdown.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2025/04/07/is-this-the-beginning/#my-portfolio","title":"My portfolio","text":"<p>Let's not forget that the blog is directly linked to my portfolio which is also part of this project.

Obviously I am aware that I still have a lot to learn and starting from the portfolio to get to the blog I know there are many things to improve (I also trust in your support). But with time and experience and a little commitment I hope to learn new notions. The purpose of this blog is to talk about my projects, computer science and many other beautiful things, I wanted to tell you \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06.</p>"},{"location":"2025/04/07/is-this-the-beginning/#final-considerations","title":"Final considerations","text":"<p>I would like to point out that this is not a real guide, it is simply my experience that could not be completely accurate, that's why I decided to link you to all the material you need, in this way you will learn everything you need.</p>"},{"location":"archive/2025/","title":"April 2025","text":""},{"location":"category/projects/","title":"Projects","text":""}]}
